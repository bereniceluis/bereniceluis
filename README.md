- 👋 Hi, My username @muichii which is inspired on Kimetsu No Yaiba's character named Muichiro
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and finding new resources as an addition to my collection of resources that can help me learn. Also, I like sitcoms that calso serves
as an avenue to help me learn but with visuals. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python because I tried C, C++ as well as Java but sadly, I wasn't able to continue it everyday so I am starting again a new language which I hoppe
I can continue to learn until I graduate 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects! I think it'll be useful for me to learn and gain from others.
